```

## Background 

This document can be written out to many many formats. The formats are encoded in the `YAML`. You can get an idea of the available formats by inspecting the `YAML` of this document: [https://github.com/agrogan1/newstuff/blob/master/YAMLtest/index.Rmd](https://github.com/agrogan1/newstuff/blob/master/YAMLtest/index.Rmd)

Note also, that you can download the source \*.Rmd of  this document using the button in the *upper right hand corner*. This button is added by adding `code_download: yes` to the `YAML`.

> You will need to install some of these packages from CRAN

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# install.packages(c("bookdown", "distill", "revealjs", "tint", "tufte"))

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

> This is an example of a blockquote.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

library(palmerpenguins)

summary(penguins)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(penguins,
       aes(x = body_mass_g,
       y = flipper_length_mm,
       color = species)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_color_viridis_d() +
  labs(title = "Penguin Flipper Length by Body Mass") +
  theme_minimal()


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
