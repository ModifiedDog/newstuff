# The Basics

```{r}

library(DiagrammeR)

grViz("
digraph boxes_and_circles {

  # a 'graph' statement
  graph [overlap = true, 
  fontsize = 10,
  rankdir = LR]

  # several 'node' statements

# A Conceptual Focus

* Disparities: How does membership in **A** affect the chances of outcome **B**?
* Effect of a Policy or Intervention: Do those who receive treatment or policy **A** have a different outcome **B**?
* Political Participation: How does membership in **A** affect the chances of voting or candidate or policy **B**?
