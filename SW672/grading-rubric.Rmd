# The Basics

```{r}

  # a 'graph' statement
  graph [overlap = true, 
  fontsize = 10,
  rankdir = LR]

# A Conceptual Focus

* Disparities: How does membership in **A** affect the chances of outcome **B**?

--

* Effect of a Policy or Intervention: Do those who receive treatment or policy **A** have a different outcome **B**?

--

* Political Participation: How does membership in **A** affect the chances of voting or candidate or policy **B**?

# Think Carefully About Design Elements

1. Geometry: bars; lines; points; etc.
2. Use of color
3. Well labeled axes
4. Good informative title

```{r}

x <- round(rnorm(100, 100, 10), digits = 0)

```

```{r, eval=TRUE, fig.height=3}

library(ggplot2)

library(ggbeeswarm)

ggplot(data = NULL,
       aes(x = x,
           fill = factor(x))) +
  geom_histogram() +
  geom_label(aes(x = 120, 
                 y = 10, 
                 label = "possibly \ninformative \nkey takeaway"),
             size = 2, 
             fill = "white",
             color = "red") +
  ylab("possibly another \ndimension of the data") +
  xlab("one dimension of the data") +
  labs(title = "Informative Title",
       subtitle = "Maybe The Title Is Even Your Main Takeaway",
       caption = "Every extra 'dimension' (x axis, y axis, color, shape) 
       should convey information.
       \n Words should be spelled out.") +

# Wrap Your Visual In A Narrative

}
")

```

* Why is *A* important? Is *A* prevalent? Widespread? Serious?

--

* Why is *B* important? Is *B* prevalent? Widespread? Serious?

* If *A* is connected to *B*, this means: __________
* If *A* is not connected to *B*, this means: __________

# The Difficult Stuff

* More thoughtful design: Cedric Sherer has an [amazing article on improving the design of a ggplot](https://cedricscherer.netlify.app/2019/05/17/the-evolution-of-a-ggplot-ep.-1/).
* Causality
* Moderation
* Simpson's Paradox
* Bayes Theorem
